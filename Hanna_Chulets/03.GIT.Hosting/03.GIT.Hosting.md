## Script

I've decided to add alias to ~/.bashrc

```bash

alias git_push_all='for r in $(git remote); do git push -u $r main; done'

```
so that every time when I need to push main branch to all remote repos, I'll call a command git_push_all


```bash
chulets@atic:/opt/git/task3/github$ git_push_all
Branch 'main' set up to track remote branch 'main' from 'origin_bitbucket'.
